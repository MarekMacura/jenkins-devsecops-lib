1. How Grafana Alerts Work Now

Since Grafana 8+, alerts are decoupled from dashboards and stored in the Unified Alerting system.
They are defined as JSON in Grafana Alerting â†’ Alert rules (or via provisioning YAML).

Weâ€™ll provide JSON alert definitions you can import via Alerting â†’ Alert rules â†’ New â†’ Import.
You will then link them to notification policies (Slack, Email, Teams).


3. How to Use

    Replace PROMETHEUS_DS_UID with your Prometheus data source UID:
        Go to Grafana â†’ Data Sources â†’ Prometheus â†’ Settings
        Find the UID in the URL (/datasources/edit/<UID>)
    Go to Alerting â†’ Alert rules â†’ New â†’ Import
    Paste this JSON
    Save
    Go to Alerting â†’ Notification policies
        Add rules for:
            Slack
            Email
            Microsoft Teams
        Match on severity=critical or severity=warning
